# Menu Swapper for WordPress

Contextually swaps menus in your theme for logged in users - for WordPress!

## What is Kneejerk Development Menu Swapper

This is a WordPress Plugin designed to allow you to contextualize the menus in your theme based on
whether or not your visitor is logged in or not. It's especially handy when this functionality is
not built into your theme!

Please report any bugs or feel free to give me any feedback at

## How does it work

After installing KJD Menu Swapper, you'll see the Menu Swapper on the left admin navigation (at this
point, you're probably already familiar with it). Once you click there, you'll be presented with the
configuration for the plugin. This plugin does a few things to work:

1.  KJD grabs the menus that your theme has registered. Whatever your theme, if it registers its menus
    properly, KJD Menu Swapper will find it =]

2.  KJD then grabs the menus that you've configured under Appearance -> Menus

3.  If a menu is configured for a registered theme menu, KJD Menu Swapper will show you. Otherwise,
    it'll say "None Selected" like this:
    ![Example](/images/twenty_twenty_example.png)

4.  In the dropdown next to what the theme is configured for, you have the option to "swap" it when the
    visitor is logged in:
    ![Menu Select](/images/twenty_twenty_menu_select.png)

5.  Click the enable checkbox for that menu to enable the swap:
    ![Enable Swap](/images/twenty_twenty_configure_enable.png)

6.  Next, bonk the "Save" button, and the menu swap is live!
    ![Bonk save](/images/twenty_twenty_save.png)

## A Note from the Author

It's designed to be pretty easy to use, but this plugin will only get better with constructive feedback
from people who are using it like you!

More great plugins to come, so keep in touch, and stay tuned to Kneejerk Development!
